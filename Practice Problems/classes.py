#Multiple Inheritance
#1. Create two classes Writer and Editor, each with a method role(). Inherit a class Author from both and override role() to describe an authorâ€™s combined role.

class Writer:
    def role(self):
        print("Writes content")

class Editor:
    def role(self):
        print("Edits content")

class Author(Writer, Editor):
    def role(self):
        print("Writes and edits content as an author")
        
author = Author()
author.role()
