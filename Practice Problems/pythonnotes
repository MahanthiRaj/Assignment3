1. Variables - a variables will hold the data which is assigned to it and variable cannot start with number 
 and we cannot use the special characters 
 
example:  hello(variable) = 5(data)
            
    Do's                  Dont's
          hello_        Hello-
          Hello         9hello
          HeLLo2        Hello@
          hello_my
          HELLO

 problem : a = 5
           b = 6
           print(a+b)

2. DataTypes - Variable will stores the data in different types like (string, inte, boolean)
